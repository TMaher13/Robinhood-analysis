# Robinhood-analysis
Access Robinhood account, analyze stock data, and make predictions about what stocks you should buy.

Within this project, 3 main scripts will be used to complete the following:

  1. Access Robinhood account.

      a. Report movement of stocks owned for today.

      b. Buy/sell stocks from the command line.

  2. Use the Stocker Toolkit to get stock data (quandl based package)

      a. Use Stocker toolkit to show price data and steps in training/testing of prediction model

      b. Give suggestions from predictions for valuations of stocks

  3. Build my own classifier for stock analysis with ML

      a. Build a classifier with classes: 'Buy', 'Hold', 'Sell'

      b. Possibly, later on move towards building my own stock price predictor (although the Efficient Market Hypothesis dissuades me from doing so)
