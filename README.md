# Robinhood-analysis
Access Robinhood account, analyze stock data, and make predictions about what stocks you should buy.

With this project I intend it to fulfill several tasks, which are described below.
The list will be appended as I find other uses for this project.

  1. Access Robinhood account.
    
      a. Report movement of stocks owned for today.
    
      b. Buy/sell stocks from the command line.
      
  2. Call the IEX (Investors Exchange) API and analyze specific stocks.
    
      a. Initially just look at historical data
    
      b. Eventually build project to the point where we can run ML to make future stock predictions.
